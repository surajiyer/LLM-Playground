However, such delays and setbacks are less troubling when you turn 36 years old, which is when Saturn matures. Saturn teaches us the value of perseverance, focus, concentration, discipline, structure, organization, consistency, detachment, loyalty, and responsibility. Saturn is a public servant in the planetary cabinet. So, health-care workers, lawyers, accountants, administrators, social workers, or public servants of any kind are associated with Saturn. Saturn is a significator of land and therefore all professions related to the real-estate or the farming industry are linked to Saturn.

Saturn never takes the eyes of the end goal, is rarely demotivated with set-backs, is prepared to wait for the right time, and prefers earning what he deserves. Saturn excels in the manufacturing industry, finance (risk-assessment), medicine, or research of any kind. Saturn thrives in highly structured companies, large corporations, an independent business, or highly regulated industries such as the Oil & Gas industry. Saturn’s style of leadership is shaped by empathy and years of experience. Saturn works for the people by being amongst them unlike Sun who only prefers to lead and others to follow. And therefore, Saturn is a very likable leader. In terms of personality and physical appearance, Saturn is conservative, patient, old-fashioned, risk-averse but ambitious, practical, trustworthy, grounded, lover of all things ancient, a student of ancient sciences or history, is a miser, thin, tall, sinewy, prominent veins, darkish in complexion, thick & rough hair, large asymmetrical teeth, nails are not shaped, eyes have a yellowish tinge and deep in the socket, somber demeanor, lazy, slow mover, aging appearance but strong body, and clad in black.

But Rahu is a very impatient planet and tries to do too many things - People with Rahu in the 7th house want to get married soon and people with Rahu in the 10th house want to achieve early success.

Rahu’s energy is erratic and therefore it leads to sudden, dramatic, and unplanned events in life. So, we find ourselves in unchartered territories due to Rahu such as quitting our job to start a business, traveling to a different country, being in a relationship with a foreign person, or dealing with unique health problems, etc. Rahu is the king of desires and a giver. We can achieve extraordinary things in life due to Rahu. It fulfills our desires more than any other planet but happiness through materialism, as they say, is short-lived. Once the smoke clears, we find ourselves deluded by Rahu. The ruler of the sign that Rahu occupies determines where most opportunities lie. Rahu is associated with dance, music, drama, magic, hunting, chemicals, thorny trees, bitter vegetables, onion, garlic, spices, places where reptiles live, and skin ailments. Has only the top half of the body, the bottom half is Ketu. Has a smoky black appearance, is clad in rags, talkative, exceedingly proud, and lives in the forests. Rahu is obsessive, compulsive, perverted, addictive, manipulative, demonic, causing destruction, being thievish, cunning, and irreligious. Therefore, one could be imprisoned, isolated, become an addict, or suffer from mental illness, if Rahu is uncontrolled. Rahu magnifies the qualities of other planets. A Sun-Rahu conjunction results in an over-inflated ego, a delusion about self, but fame too. A Moon-Rahu conjunction results in being overexcited and driven by emotions.

So Ketu in the 7th house detaches you from the desire to get married, you may get married but late in life, similarly Ketu in the 11th house detaches you from the desire to hoard money and so on. I’ve seen it with many people with Ketu in the 11th house that they donate a large part of what they earn. Ketu represents everything we’ve already mastered in our past lives, and hence the desire to achieve the same again is low. Ketu’s time period, like Rahu’s, can also be quite dramatic, especially when you forcibly try to change the natural order. Since Ketu’s time period detaches you the world, it is also the planet that can inspire you towards spirituality.\n",

Ketu is an expert in ancient science, tantra, occult, esoteric philosophy, and working with chemicals. It possesses psychic ability and clairvoyance, is high intuitive, a strategic thinker, has piercing logic, and understands trends easily. Ketu excels in the field of research, espionage, mathematics, and finance. Ketu is tamasic (dark), cruel, rebellious, eccentric, explosive, capable of saying mean things, and is addicted to drugs. It stands for hardships, isolation, imprisonment, and loss of worldly possessions. A loss of a job, a court case, a sudden change of residence, or a loss of a loved one can be due to Ketu. It forces us to be less worldly. If Ketu is well-placed it drives us towards spiritually and liberation. Ketu is not pleasing to look at, has a worried look, lacks confidence due to self-doubts, has a tall and lean body, which is body marred with wounds and bruises, is clad in rags, and works in places where there is high smoke. A Moon – Ketu conjunction pollutes the mind with fears and phobias. Sun- Ketu results in a lack of confidence and issues with authority.

People born with a strong Sagittarius placement are always up for an adventure such as traveling to new places, taking up a new job/project, or simply trying new things. Every adventure teaches them valuable lessons on life, and their experience makes them quite wise. It is also the sign of higher education, and beliefs.\n",

Planets such as Mars do exceptionally well in this sign since Mars' pent up energy finds direction here. This sign influences your career & public life but it is not as important as the role of the 10th house or the planet, Sun.\n",

They have little regard for rules & regulations and are often seen pushing the boundaries that make them quite fascinating. Another interesting thing about them is that they are good at rallying people around them, especially for a humanitarian cause. Scientists, writers, and public speakers all have strong Aquarius.\n",

They can dive deep into the realms of imagination and come up with things never heard or seen before. So a lot of fiction writers have a strong Piscean connection.\n",
